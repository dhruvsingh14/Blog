Now, 

Most of this seems to be working. 

(correct me if I'm wrong, but chat didn't modify much of anything else on the contrader class?)

Need to verify that optimize functionality wasn't changed even if revised syntax was suggested.


1. Now, I would like to be able to specify AUDEUR inline in the notebook rather than navigating to the top each time. Might need a solution for that. A redundant function of sorts or, set globals for data pull up top, and locals inline.

2. Next, I'd like to get an MVP going for the remaining strategies today. 

3. Slicing functionality needs to be working. [[Using Strat1 as example. Might be because attributes for start and end weren't added]]

4. Why isn't window being updated for contrader test_strategy?

5. update comments for contrader using chat's updates

Ask yourself - is this too messy of a notebook? how can it be cleaned up?

6. Want to be able to pull more data than the 60 second timeoutm using sleep etc. 

Note: Go back to original notebooks and test the cases in there using your revised code

Architecture Question: Ask about running executable scripts vs. notebooks

Low hanging fruit. 

Add the ML Backtester Class.

Ask what the iterative backtest class is doing. Even if it doesn't fit with your current blogpost, see if you have some use for it down the line!
